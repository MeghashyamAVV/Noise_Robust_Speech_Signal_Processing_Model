Enhancing Speech-to-Text Model Performance in Noisy Environments through Advanced Feature Engineering

Speech-to-text models have always had a difficult time in noisy environments where the presence of irrelevant sounds, and overlapping speech significantly reduces transcription accuracy. When dealing with real-world scenarios like healthcare, telecommunication, and assistive technologies, this challenge hinders the process of communication. Hence, managing noise types, ensuring data quality, and addressing class imbalances are crucial to improving model scalability and performance in formal and informal real-world settings.
